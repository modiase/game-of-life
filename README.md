# Game of Life

Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automaton created by mathematician John Conway in 1970. It's a zero-player game where cells on a grid evolve according to simple rules:

## Rules

1. **Underpopulation**: Live cells with fewer than 2 neighbors die
2. **Survival**: Live cells with 2-3 neighbors survive
3. **Overpopulation**: Live cells with more than 3 neighbors die
4. **Reproduction**: Dead cells with exactly 3 neighbors become alive
